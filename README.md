# Pink Encryption Workshop
Unleash your inner hacker with Pink!

Hello and Welcome to our workshop on the 14th of May! We will be talking about encryption algorithms and their real-life use-cases, write awesome code in Java, and solve some riddles :)

Please prepare for the workshop by following the steps below.

### Setup

1. You will need Java on your computer, you can download JDK 17 here: https://www.oracle.com/java/technologies/javase/jdk17-archive-downloads.html 

2. I will be using IntelliJ during the workshop, but any of the following editors can do the job :)
   * IntelliJ: https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/download/#section=windows
   * Eclipse: https://www.eclipse.org/downloads/
   * Visual Studio Code: https://code.visualstudio.com/download

3. Clone this repository!

4. Open the project in your code editor, and try running the `main` method in the `src.pink.AmIWorking` class :)

### The project

In the project you can find the following things:
* The `pink.workshop` package contains the classes where we will be writing our code during the workshop
  * `FileUtils` is there to help us read and write files
  * We will implement the empty methods in `CBC`, `RSA` and `XOR`
* The `pink.riddle` package contains the riddles you will be solving during the second half of the workshop!
* The `resources` folder contains files connected to your riddles, each riddle has its own folder

Exciting, right? ;) See you soon!
