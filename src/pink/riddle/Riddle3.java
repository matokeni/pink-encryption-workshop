/**
 * YouÂ´re code cracker business gets an urgent call, the client says that the hacker is in their house,

 *
 * You waste no time, and get to their house ASAP. But oh no, the hacker must have heard you coming, and
 * disappeared into the night. You take a look at the client's computer, and you notice that the hacker's
 * malicious encryption virus is still running. You see the following window on the screen:
